Channel
=======

Information about a color element in the image.

Access through the Document.channels collection. You can access an individual channel object in this list by index or by name. For example, this accesses a channel object in the active document by name and assigns an opacity value::

	var channelRef = app.activeDocument.channels.getByName("my channel");
	channelRef.opacity = 22;

A channel is analogous to a plate in the printing process that applies a single color. The documentâ€™s color mode determines the number of default channels; for example, an RGB document has three channels, red, green, and blue. A color can also have an alpha channel, which stores selections as masks, or a spot channel, which stores spot colors.
